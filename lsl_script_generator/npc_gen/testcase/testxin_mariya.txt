/*
 * this file tests a challenge interaction.

 *
 * To test:
 *    create npc
 *    '/31000 -npcask'
 *    when the npc raises hand, call the name
 *    npc should say 'Hi, I think I need your help. This digital multimeter is broken'
 *    you can enter 'wire', 'connect', 'wires', 'conn'
 *    npc should say 'Yes, I misconnected the wires.'
 *    and go to idle
 *    if you enter something else npc should say 'I have tried that!'
 *	 and repeat the question
 *    if you use
 *    '/31000 -npcask2'
 *    when the npc raises hand, call the name
 *    npc should say 'Can you take a look at my digital multimeter? I might have broken it.' and play sound am_I_correct
 *    you can enter 'wire', 'connect', 'ABCDE'
 *    npc should say 'Yes, I probably messed up the wires.'
 *    if you enter something else npc should say 'I have tried that!'
