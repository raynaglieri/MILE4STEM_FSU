/*
 * this file test the basic interaction. After '/31000 -s1_q1',
 * the NPC will raise hand to ask a question.
 * when his name is called upon, the NPC will say 'msg_for_s1'.
 * After that, if the user responded in the public channel 
 * with one of "responses", "to", or "s1_q1",
 * the npc will say 'msg1_for_response 1' and go back to idle
 * or if the user responded in the public channel with two of 
 * '111', '222', or '333', the npc will say 'msg1_for_response 2'
 * all other responses with trigger the npc is say 'AAA' and play an
 * animation (exp_anim) and then repeat for the 'msg_for_s1' sequence.
 *
 * To test:
 *   create the npc
 *   '/31000 -s1_q1'
 *   when the npc raises hand, call the name ('John' by default)
 *   the npc should then say: 'msg_for_s1'
 *   you may answer 'to' to '111 222" to perform specified actions,
 *   or input anything to get 'AAA'
 *
 *   You can repeat '/31000 -s1_q1' whenever you want
 *
