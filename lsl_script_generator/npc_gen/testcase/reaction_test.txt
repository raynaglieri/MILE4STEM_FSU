/*

 * this file test the basic reaction. After '/31000 -s1_r1',

 * NPC appears bored - animations (avatar_express_bored, avatar_away). 

 * When his name is called upon, the NPC will say "yes".

 * After that, if the user responded in the public channel 

 * with one of "pay attention", "concentrate", "focus"

 * the npc will say 'I just got distracted' and go to idle state

 * all other responses will trigger the npc to say 'whatever' and get back to

 * animations (avatar_express_bored, avatar_away).
 * 

 * to test:

 *   create the npc

 *   then '/31000-s1_r1'

 *   npc looks bored, call the name ('John' by default)

 *   the npc should then say: 'yes'

 *   you may answer "pay attention", "concentrate", "focus" to perform specified actions,

 *   or input anything to get 'whatever' and npc returns to a bored state
