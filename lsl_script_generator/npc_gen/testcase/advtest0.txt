/*
 * this tests an NPC with three moods, depending on the mood
 * the npc may react to the same command in different ways
 * each may have its own timed activities
 * use '/31000 -goto:statename' to go to state 'statename'
 * for example '/31000 -goto:badmood'.
 *
 * to test:
 *   create the npc
 *   '/31000 -three1'
 *   you may wait some time to see the time triggered action
 *   '/31000 -goto:badmood'
 *   '/31000 -three1'    npc would have a different action from the previous one
 *   you may wait some time to see the time triggered actions
 *   '/31000 -goto:goodmood'
 *   '/31000 -three1'    another new set of actions
 *   '/31000 -goto:default'    go back to the default state
 *
